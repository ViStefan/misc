# misc
doubiously useful write-n-throw scripts, that could be interesting to look through after some time

* [**pascal**](pascal/) вычисление элемента (x, y) треугольника Паскаля с хвостовой рекурсией
* [**bb2md**](bb2md/) convert forum's bb-codes to markdown, written in`sed`
* [**.zshrc**](.zshrc) `zsh` config for God-object singleton session of `tmux`
* [**add_trackers**](add_trackers) `bash` script for adding multiple announce servers to `.torrent` files for speeding up and support slow torrents. Requires `transmission`. Executed with no arguments, adds announce URI's to all `.torrent` files in default `./config/transmission/torrents` dir. Runned with arguments, adds announce servers to passed `.torrent` files. Written as a replacement for `transmission-trackers` AUR package, whose redundancy amazed me.
